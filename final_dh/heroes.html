                <p>
                    Biography: Zhou Enlai, born on March 5, 1898, in Huai'an, Jiangsu, was one of the key leaders of the
                    Chinese Communist Party, a principal founder of the People's Liberation Army, and a founding father
                    of the People's Republic of China.
                    <br><br>
                    Early Life: Zhou Enlai was involved in the founding of the Chinese Communist Party and held
                    significant positions within the Red Army.
                    <br><br>
                    Long March Journey: During the Long March, Zhou Enlai was responsible for supervising the
                    implementation of military preparation plans. He maintained a firm belief in the revolutionary
                    victory of the Red Army and upheld strict discipline and an optimistic revolutionary spirit in
                    extremely harsh conditions.
                    <br><br>
                    Outstanding Contributions and Heroic Deeds: Zhou Enlai was particularly busy during the Long March,
                    bearing major responsibilities for the Military Commission. At each stop, he would have telegraph
                    lines set up to receive messages from various corps and hang maps to decide on marching and combat
                    routes. While crossing the grasslands, he fell ill due to exhaustion and malnutrition, suffering
                    from a persistent high fever of 40°C and remaining unconscious for days. Despite this, he continued
                    to work until soldiers carried him out of the grasslands. Zhou Enlai's perseverance and
                    determination greatly inspired the morale and fighting spirit of the Red Army.

                    gather wild vegetables for sustenance and compiled a booklet titled "Guidelines for Eating Wild
                    Vegetables," distributing it to each company, showing his deep care for the soldiers.

                    Biography: Chen Shuxiang, born in 1905 in Changsha, Hunan, was the commander of the 34th Division of
                    the Red Army.
                    <br><br>
                    Early Life: After a severe drought in his hometown, Chen fled to Changsha with his father. There, he
                    met Mao Zedong and Yang Kaihui's family, and under their influence, he joined the revolution.
                    <br><br>
                    Long March Journey: In October 1934, Chen Shuxiang led his troops in the Long March of the Central

                    nights, suffering heavy casualties. Despite being severely wounded in the abdomen, he continued to
                    command the battle. Ultimately, after being captured, he seized an opportunity, endured excruciating
                    pain, and pulled out his intestines from the wound, breaking them to sacrifice himself heroically at
                    the age of 29.

                    Biography: He Zizhen, born in 1909 in Yongxin, Jiangxi, was the first female Communist Party member
                    in Jinggangshan.
                    <br><br>
                    Early Life: He Zizhen grew up amidst the turbulent times of the Great Revolution and matured in the
                    fierce battles of Jinggangshan.
                    <br><br>
                    Long March Journey: In October 1934, after the failure of the fifth counter-encirclement campaign,
                    the Central Red Army began the Long March, and He Zizhen embarked on this arduous journey alongside
                    Mao Zedong.
                    <br><br>
                    Outstanding Contributions and Heroic Deeds: In early April 1935, one evening, the female Red Army
                    soldiers had just arrived at Wulipai near Pan County, Guizhou, exhausted. Suddenly, enemy planes
                    attacked. He Zizhen was injured by shellfire while rescuing wounded soldiers. A guard rode to the
                    General Health Department to bring Dr. Li Zhi for her treatment. Dr. Li first administered a
                    hemostatic injection to He Zizhen and then conducted a full examination. She discovered 17 shrapnel
                    pieces of varying sizes and depths in He Zizhen's head, torso, and limbs. The surgery began without
                    any anesthesia. He Zizhen was drenched in sweat from the pain, tears welling in her eyes, yet she
                    remained silent. The shrapnel near the surface was eventually removed piece by piece, but those
                    deeply embedded became a permanent reminder of the war.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Yu Qiuli was an outstanding leader in political work for our army, a founder of the new China's
                    petroleum industry, and an exceptional leader in economic affairs. During a battle in the Long
                    March, he lost his left arm but persevered with his remaining arm until the revolution's victory. In
                    1955, he was awarded the rank of Lieutenant General and was known as the "One-Armed General," the
                    only general of his rank to have served as Vice Premier.
                    <br><br>
                    In one campaign, Yu Qiuli's left arm was pierced by a bullet, exposing bone and tendons, and
                    bleeding profusely. The war conditions were extremely harsh, with a severe lack of medical supplies,
                    making timely surgery impossible. He had to endure the pain and continue north with the troops.
                    <br><br>
                    During the march, his wound became infected and was infested with maggots. When the pain was
                    unbearable, he would soak his injured arm in cold water to relieve it. It wasn't until they emerged
                    from the grasslands that a doctor in Longnan used a razor to remove the decayed flesh and performed
                    an amputation with an ordinary saw blade. Through his actions, he set an example for the Red Army
                    soldiers, demonstrating fearless heroism.
