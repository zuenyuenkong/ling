            <h2>The Xiangjiang Campaign</h2>
            <p>
                During the period of the Land Revolution, the Central Red Army was engaged in a critical battle to break
                through the fourth line of blockade established by the Kuomintang army in the Xiangjiang region of
                northern Guangxi during their Long March.
                <br><br>
                The Xiangjiang Campaign was a battle that determined the life and death of the Central Red Army. From
                November 27 to December 1, 1934, the Central Red Army fought fiercely for five days and nights against
                the Kuomintang forces in the mountainous areas of Xing'an, Quanzhou, and Guanyang in Guangxi.
                <img src="images/battles1.png" alt="">
                <br>
                Ultimately, they succeeded in crossing the Xiangjiang River between Quanzhou and Xing'an, thereby
                breaking through the fourth line of blockade. This victory thwarted Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to
                encircle and annihilate the Central Red Army east of the Xiangjiang River. However, this success came at
                an enormous cost. The number of troops and personnel in the Central Committee plummeted from over 80,000
                at the start of the Long March to just over 30,000.
                <br><br>
                The Xiangjiang Campaign was the most heroic and crucial battle since the Central Red Army began its
                breakout. Our forces engaged in fierce combat against a numerically superior enemy, ultimately tearing
                through the heavily fortified blockade line and dismantling Chiang Kai-shek’s plan to encircle the Red
                Army east of the Xiangjiang. Although the Red Army managed to breach the fourth line of blockade, the
                price paid was staggering. The 5th Corps and the newly formed International Brigade suffered over fifty
                percent losses, while the 8th Corps faced even greater devastation. The 34th Division was heavily
                surrounded, and its officers and soldiers fought valiantly until they ran out of ammunition and
                supplies, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of the majority of their comrades. After crossing the
                Xiangjiang River, the Central Red Army and the two divisions of the Military Commission had dwindled
                from 86,000 at the start to just 30,000. This led to widespread doubt and dissatisfaction among many
                cadres and soldiers regarding Wang Ming's military strategy, with increasing calls for a change in
                leadership.
                <br><br>
                The bittersweet victory at the Xiangjiang directly resulted in the convening of an expanded meeting of
                the Central Political Bureau in Zunyi (historically known as the “Zunyi Conference”). This meeting was
                held when the Red Army was besieged and in dire straits, establishing the correct leadership of the new
                Central Committee centered around Mao Zedong and affirming Mao's leadership within both the Red Army and
                the Central Committee.

            <h2>The Four Crossings of the Chishui River Campaig</h2>
            <p>
                During the period of the Land Revolution, the Central Red Army engaged in a series of mobile warfare
                battles against the Kuomintang forces in the basin of the Chishui River, located at the intersection of
                Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces during their Long March.
                <br><br>
                <img src="images/battles2.png" alt="">
                <br>
                The Four Crossings of the Chishui River Campaign was a decisive mobile battle that took place after the
                Zunyi Conference, amid the perilous circumstances of the Central Red Army being pursued and besieged by
                hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang troops. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De,
                the Red Army adopted a highly mobile strategy, maneuvering freely across the vast areas of the
                Sichuan-Guizhou-Yunnan border. They actively sought opportunities for engagement, effectively mobilizing
                and destroying enemy forces, and ultimately thwarted Chiang Kai-shek’s ambitious plan to encircle the
                Red Army in this region. This campaign resulted in a strategically significant victory during their
                retreat.
                <br><br>
                Over the course of three months, Mao Zedong directed the Central Red Army in six crossings of three
                rivers, skillfully navigating between the encircled positions of the Kuomintang forces. By constantly
                seizing opportunities for battle, they managed to inflict substantial losses on the enemy, firmly
                establishing the initiative on the battlefield. This campaign stands as a brilliant example in the
                history of the Long March, showcasing how a smaller force can triumph over a larger one, turning a
                passive situation into an active one.

            <h2>The Battle of Luding Bridge</h2>
            <p>
                The Battle of Luding Bridge was a crucial engagement during the Long March of the Red Army, taking place
                in May 1935. The context of this battle involved the Red Army's urgent need to cross the Dadu River to
                escape relentless enemy pursuit, with Luding Bridge serving as a vital route to the enemy's rear.
                <br><br>
                At that time, the Red Army faced severe challenges; the enemy's blockade made crossing the river
                extremely difficult. The bridge, narrow and dilapidated from years of weathering, was precariously weak.
                However, its strategic importance could not be overlooked. The Red Army decided to take bold action,
                aiming to seize the bridge before the enemy could respond.
                <br>
                <img src="images/battles3.png" alt="">
                <br>
                On May 29, 1935, Commander Deng Xiaoping ordered the assault. To ensure success, Red Army soldiers moved
                under the cover of night, dividing into small groups to approach the bridge stealthily. The battle broke
                out at dawn, with Red Army fighters using agile tactics to quickly ascend the bridge and engage in
                fierce combat. Despite the enemy's attempts to defend it, they were swiftly repelled by the Red Army's
                surprise attack and indomitable spirit.
                <br><br>
                Throughout the battle, the Red Army soldiers demonstrated extraordinary courage and tenacity. Facing a
                hail of bullets, they pressed forward fearlessly, ultimately capturing Luding Bridge. This victory not
                only created favorable conditions for the Red Army's subsequent maneuvers but also significantly boosted
                morale, reinforcing the soldiers' confidence in the success of the Long March.

                <p>
                    On March 30, 1936, under the orders of Red Army Commander Zhu De and Political Commissar Zhang
                    Guotao,
                    the Second and Sixth Armies crossed the Jinsha River during their Long March. They endured harsh
                    conditions as they traversed the towering Snow Mountains, and on July 2, they finally met up with
                    the
                    Fourth Front Army in Ganzi.
                    <br><br>
                    Upon receiving this news, the Central Committee directed the Second and Sixth Armies to merge into
                    the
                    Second Front Army, incorporating the 32nd Army as well. He Long was appointed as the overall
                    commander,
                    with Ren Bishi serving as the political commissar. At this time, although Zhang Guotao had disbanded
                    his
                    rival "central" authority, he still maintained a confrontational stance against the Central
                    Committee.
                    He attempted to enlist the newly united Second Front Army to support his misguided activities and
                    proposals, but his efforts were met with strong resistance from the army’s leaders.
                    <br><br>
                    With the determined efforts of Zhu De, Liu Bocheng, Ren Bishi, He Long, and Guan Xiangying, the
                    Second
                    and Fourth Front Armies resolved to advance north together and reunite with the Central Committee
                    and
                    the First Front Army.
