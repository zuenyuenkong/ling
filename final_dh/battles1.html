            <h2>The Xiangjiang Campaign</h2>
            <p>
                During the period of the Land Revolution, the Central Red Army was engaged in a critical battle to break
                through the fourth line of blockade established by the Kuomintang army in the Xiangjiang region of
                northern Guangxi during their Long March.
                <br><br>
                The Xiangjiang Campaign was a battle that determined the life and death of the Central Red Army. From
                November 27 to December 1, 1934, the Central Red Army fought fiercely for five days and nights against
                the Kuomintang forces in the mountainous areas of Xing'an, Quanzhou, and Guanyang in Guangxi.

                <br>
                Ultimately, they succeeded in crossing the Xiangjiang River between Quanzhou and Xing'an, thereby
                breaking through the fourth line of blockade. This victory thwarted Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to
                encircle and annihilate the Central Red Army east of the Xiangjiang River. However, this success came at
                an enormous cost. The number of troops and personnel in the Central Committee plummeted from over 80,000
                at the start of the Long March to just over 30,000.
                <br><br>
                The Xiangjiang Campaign was the most heroic and crucial battle since the Central Red Army began its
                breakout. Our forces engaged in fierce combat against a numerically superior enemy, ultimately tearing
                through the heavily fortified blockade line and dismantling Chiang Kai-shek’s plan to encircle the Red
                Army east of the Xiangjiang. Although the Red Army managed to breach the fourth line of blockade, the
                price paid was staggering. The 5th Corps and the newly formed International Brigade suffered over fifty
                percent losses, while the 8th Corps faced even greater devastation. The 34th Division was heavily
                surrounded, and its officers and soldiers fought valiantly until they ran out of ammunition and
                supplies, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of the majority of their comrades. After crossing the
                Xiangjiang River, the Central Red Army and the two divisions of the Military Commission had dwindled
                from 86,000 at the start to just 30,000. This led to widespread doubt and dissatisfaction among many
                cadres and soldiers regarding Wang Ming's military strategy, with increasing calls for a change in
                leadership.
                <br><br>
                The bittersweet victory at the Xiangjiang directly resulted in the convening of an expanded meeting of
                the Central Political Bureau in Zunyi (historically known as the “Zunyi Conference”). This meeting was
                held when the Red Army was besieged and in dire straits, establishing the correct leadership of the new
                Central Committee centered around Mao Zedong and affirming Mao's leadership within both the Red Army and
                the Central Committee.
